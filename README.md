_**Everything and the kitchen sink**_  

## Deployable Cloud

_True Privacy_  
I believe your files should stay with you **always**.  

- **No** third party eyes
- **No** privacy policies
- **No** tradeoffs

Given the pleathora of cloud providers and the frequent data breaches of large companies I created `sinkd` to give the power back to the user.

1. Wraps `rsync` into a user friendly way
1. Physical access to your files
1. Granular permissions per user  
1. Data restore, backup utility

### Future - Feature Enhancements

- enable `btrfs` on a virtual mount for added integrity
- add encryption to file system
- access from the interwebs
